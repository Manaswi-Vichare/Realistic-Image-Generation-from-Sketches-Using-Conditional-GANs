# Realistic-Image-Generation-from-Sketches-Using-Conditional-GANs
**Objective:**
1. To develop a system to generate realistic images from sketches using conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), where the generated images are based on the label provided as the input.
2. The generated images should represent the characteristics associated with the label given as input.

**Dataset:** ISIC Dataset. \
Images paired with their respective sketch images. Visualization of the dataset can be observed below: \

**Generated images on Test Data after 50 Epochs:** \
Note: These images were generated after only 50 epochs. Better results can be obtained by training the model for ideally 2000+ epochs. \
