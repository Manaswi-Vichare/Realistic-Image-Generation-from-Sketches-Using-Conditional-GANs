# Realistic-Image-Generation-from-Sketches-Using-Conditional-GANs
Developed a conditional GAN to generate realistic images from unpaired sketches, conditioned on class labels, and evaluated performance using FID and IS metrics. Conducted experiments to compare generated image accuracy with original dataset accuracy and integrated WandB for training logs and visualizations.
